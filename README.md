# DiaryBuddy App Implementation Summary
A full Android app implementation with a beautiful glassmorphism UI similar to Circle to Search, featuring a gradient background with pastel colors and a transparent bottom navigation bar. 

The app follows the MVI (Model-View-Intent) architecture pattern and includes three main features:

### 1. Voice Assistant Feature
- Implemented using Google's Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech APIs
- Allows users to ask questions and get AI-generated responses
- The UI shows a chat-like interface with user and assistant messages
- Messages are displayed in stylish chat bubbles with pastel colors

### 2. Screen Reader Feature
- Captures screen content (simulated in our implementation)
- Processes the content using the AI service to generate summaries
- Reads the summary back to the user using Text-to-Speech
- Features a clean UI with a refresh button to update the content

### 3. Note-Taking Feature
- Continuously listens to user's voice input
- Transcribes speech to text in real-time
- Displays the transcribed text on screen
- Provides a save button to store the notes

## Architecture Components
We've organized the code following the MVI architecture:

### 1. Model Layer:
- Domain models: `ChatMessage`, `FeatureType`, `SpeechState`
- Repository interfaces: `AIRepository`
- Use cases: `ProcessQueryUseCase`

### 2. View Layer:
- UI components: `GlassmorphismScreen`, `ChatContent`, `NoteContent`, `SummaryContent`
- Theme: Custom colors for glassmorphism effect

### 3. Intent Layer:
- Events: `MainEvent` (Activate, Exit, FeatureSelected, StartListening, StopListening)
- State: `MainState` (Hidden, Active)

### 4. Services:
- `VoiceRecognitionService`: Handles speech recognition
- `ScreenContentService`: Captures and processes screen content
- `GenerativeAIService`: Generates AI responses

## Key Features
### 1. Glassmorphism UI:
- Gradient background with pastel colors
- Transparent white surfaces with subtle blur effects
- Rounded corners and soft shadows
### 2. Continuous Speech Recognition:
- Automatically restarts listening after processing results
- Handles errors gracefully
- Updates UI state based on listening status

### 3. Text-to-Speech Integration:
- Speaks AI responses and screen content summaries
- Configurable speech rate and pitch

### 4. State Management:
- Uses Kotlin Flow for reactive state updates
- Clean separation of concerns with the MVI pattern
